            <h5>With the motto BE AMONG THEM the organization has addressed several issues such as learning levels,<br /> dropout rates, child rights, and teacher training. Their programs focus on education, vocational training,<br/> technology, vulnerable
                children, and research and advocacy. Notably, it’s research and assessment<br/> unit publishes the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), which is the only annual source of data on children’s learning outcome<br/> in the country today.This
                aims to redeﬁne what is possible for children from low-income communities to achieve through its network of<br/> high-performing public-private partnership schools.Parents actively engage in the process of their child’s development through
                programs
                <br/> such as the School Management Committee, parent literacy classes, parent volunteerism and community-wide efforts to address<br/> key issues such as women’s empowerment,substance abuse, physical violence and others.<br/><br/>Working
                directly with children and youth as well as through large-scale collaborations with government systems.<br/> Across the spectrum from Early Childhood Education to Secondary Education, our programs strive to achieve focused<br/> objectives
                across different segments, as defined by our understanding of existing gaps and the impact of our<br/> innovations over time.Educate Girls currently operates successfully in over 18,000+ villages in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and<br/> Uttar
                Pradesh. By leveraging the Government’s existing investment in schools and by engaging with a huge base of community volunteers,<br/> Educate Girls helps to identify, enrol and retain out-of-school girls and to improve foundational skills
                in literacy and numeracy<br/> for all children (both girls and boys). This helps deliver measurable results to a large number of children and avoids parallel delivery of services.</h5><br/><br/><button class="mdl-button mdl-js-button mdl-button--raised mdl-button--colored">
