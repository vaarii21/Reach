            <h5>According to the UNICEF report, India reported deaths of 8,82,000 children below five years in 2018. It highlights that every second child below the age of five in the country is affected by some form of malnutrition. Millions of children
                in India die of treatable conditions every year. The lack of access to healthcare and expensive treatments, force these children to suffer silently with diseases that could easily be treated.<br/><br/> According to a report by the UNâ€™s
                Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UNIGME), 802,000 infants died in India in the year 2017 due to the lack of access to proper healthcare, sanitation, nutrition, and water. Even though these numbers are the lowest in 5
                years, India still has the highest infant mortality rate in the world with almost 4 lakh more deaths than Nigeria who came in second. As per the 2019 government data, India has reduced its infant mortality rate (IMR) by 42% over 11 years-from
                57 per 1,000 live births in 2006 to 33 in 2017. This is a first for a large country like India, and active efforts by both the government and nonprofits, that have worked to bring the positive change. Their combined efforts work to not
                only save children in need but also provide medical aid to expecting mothers.Around one per hundred organizations primarily or subsidiarily involved in health activities has a hospital. The corresponding figures for outpatient clinics
                are around 9% and health system supportive services are about 11%. An overwhelming number of NGOs, about 84%, are found in outreach activities. The outreach activity is the main health activity for more than 60% of NGOs functioning primarily
                in health sector. The outreach activities is the main health activity of about 88% of subsidiary health-NGOs in India. Generating awareness to targeted population is the major sub-component of outreach for Indian NGOs. Around 68 out of
                100 NGOs have reported health awareness as their outreach activity. The health sector functioning of NGOs is not a mutually exclusive set of activities; an organization may play roles in several health activities simultaneously.In India,
                NGO-run hospitals are heterogeneous and vary in terms of ownership, financing and costs. In recent past, in about ten health-oriented projects of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, NGOs have actively taken
                part as health service providers to the financing agent (fund management) based on their level of capacity (for instance, Mother-NGO Scheme). All those NGO-schemes are now under the provision of flexi-pools in National Health Mission (NHM).
                Besides, some NGOs (especially the national counterparts of international NGOs and faith-based organizations) might have their own health financing schemes. Those that are present in rural areas and part of development programs, function
                for the community by providing primary and secondary services. For example, SEWA-Rural in Gujarat, was assigned the responsibility of providing community-based health services in a district covering 40 villages with a population size 35,000.
                In the mid-eighties, the State Government of Gujarat turned over the services of ten health sub-centers to this NGO with a block grant (Dave 1990). Berman and Dave (1994) reviewed that despite substantial government grant, VHS hospital
                in Tamil Nadu collected 57 percent of revenue from patients as user fees. Nundy (2005) pointed out that the out-of- pocket payment by patients is a common source for taking care of recurrent costs in NGO-run hospitals in India. Most primary
                health centers and dispensaries run by the non-governmental sector, however, charge a nominal fee from the users. NGO-run secondary and tertiary-level hospitals charge fee for service from those who can afford in order to cross-subsidize;
                but those in urban areas are sometimes inaccessible to many. Alongside health care facilities, NGOs are also involved in several preventive care activities, perhaps more than curative care. As a case study, Nanjunda and Dinesha (2011)
                showed how several NGOs are involved in creating health awareness among tribals through various community-based approaches including door-to-door information flow, street plays, visuals and debates in tribal panchayats. Indeed, the nature
                and focus of individual NGOs vary extensively, and it becomes difficult to make generalization about the sector as a whole. A further level of complexity arises for the existence of non-governmental sector because of several legal provisions
                in India.</h5><br/><br/><button class="mdl-button mdl-js-button mdl-button--raised mdl-button--colored">
